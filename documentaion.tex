	Least  squares is a statistical method used to determine a line of best 
	by minimizing the sum of squares created by a mathematical function. 
	
	QR factorization of a matrix is the decomposition of a matrix D into a product 
	$D=QR$ of an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R. Orthogonal basis is the relation of two lines at right angles to one another and the generalization of this relation into n dimensions. Orthonormal basis is a square matrix with real entries whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors.
